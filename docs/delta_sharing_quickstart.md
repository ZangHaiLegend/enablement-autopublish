# Delta Sharing Quickstart (Field Enablement Guide)

This guide supports technical field teamsâ€”particularly those in **pre-sales, customer success, and solutions architecture roles**â€”by offering a hands-on framework for understanding and **creating technical proofs-of-concept (POC)** using Delta Sharing.

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Explain what Delta Sharing is and why it matters
- Describe use cases for cross-org data collaboration
- Launch a Delta Sharing workspace
- Share a Delta Table with an external recipient
- Create and present a pre-sales POC scenario

## ðŸŽ¯ Field POC Use Case Example

You're working with a customer in the financial services industry that needs to:
- Share anonymized transaction data with a partner
- Avoid duplicating data pipelines or compromising compliance

> In this guide, you'll simulate that exact use case by:
> - Creating a secure share
> - Adding a recipient
> - Querying data from the recipient side
> - Demonstrating it in a way that supports a pre-sales conversation

## âœ… Hands-on Practice (in Databricks Community Edition)

1. Go to the **Data** tab â†’ Create a Delta Table
2. Go to the **Sharing** tab â†’ Create a new Share
3. Add a recipient
4. Test query on the shared table
